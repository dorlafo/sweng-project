## Jass Rules - Chicane

Chicane is a variant of Jass. The rules are similar to Chibre, Pique Double, Oben Abe and Unden Ufe, so you should read these tutorials first.
It is actually a mix of those variants. Each round the player that usually selects *Atout* can select the variant to play for this round.
The big difference is that *Atout* Pique and Spade both count double, *Atout* Heart and Diamonds are normal and Oben Afe and Unden Ufe count triple. The game ends at 2'500 points.
