## Jass Rules - Roi

Roi (the King) is a variant of Jass. The rules are similar to Chibre, so you should read this tutorial first.
This variant is meant to be played with only 3 players. We all play against each other.
Although there are only 3 players, all cards are given like in the Chibre variant, 4 piles of 9 cards. Each player gets one and the fourth one stays hidden. We then return the first card of the fourth pile and the suit gives the *Atout* for the round. Then starting from the player on the right of the dealer and going counter-clockwise, all can ask to swap their cards with the fourth pile. If one player does so, no one else can.
There is a little twist. Even if one player decides to change his cards, the player holding the 6 of the same suit as the card showing the *Atout* can swap this 6 against the said card.
At the end of the turn, each player counts their points. The one with the most points scores 1 and the rest 0, unless one has less than 21 points, in that case he is consider *Pomme* and scores -1.
The game ends when someone reaches the score of 7 (or what ever score you chose together before the game starts).
