## Jass Rules - Roi

Roi (the King) is a variant of Jass. The rules are similar to Chibre, so you should read this tutorials first.
This variant is meant to be played with only 3 players. We all play against each other. 
Although we only play with 3, all cards are given like in the Chibre variant, 4 piles of 9 cards. Each player get one and the fourth one stay hidden. We then return the first card of the fourth pile and the suit gives the *Atout* for the round. Then starting from the player at the right of the dealer and going on on the right, all can ask to change their cards with the fourth pile. If one player changes, no one else can.
There is little twist. Even if one player decides to change his cards, the player holding the 6 of the same suit as the card showing the *Atout* can exchange this 6 against the said card.
At the end of the turn, each player count their points. The one with the most points scores 1. The rest 0, unless one has less than 21 points, in that case he is consider *Pomme* and scores -1.
The game ends when someone reaches the score of 7 (or what ever score you chose together before the game starts).
