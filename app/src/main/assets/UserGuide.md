### 3. Finding matches
Finding a match can be done in several ways.
- First of all, you can go to the Match List, showing you all matches available for players around the campus. Once you select the match you would like to join (depending on the variant you want to play or where the game takes place for example), simply click on it and then choose "join". You will be redirected to the Match screen, where you will be able to select your team, invite friends to come play with you and other cool features.
- Secondly you can go to the Match Map, showing you all matches on a map to better see the location of those matches. Crucial information about the match are provided directly on the marker, just press on it to see them.

### 4. Creating a match
To create your own match with your preferences, go to Create Match. You will be able to give a name to your match, invite friends, select the location and choose everything related to that match.

### 5. Play the game
Once every player joins the match, you will be notified. Once you are all together at the specified location, the game can start. When you play the game, the app will help you writing the score down and if you forget some specific rules, you can find them under "Rules".
Once the maximum amount of points is reached, the winning team will win some ranking points and the losing team loose some. This is a game and you shouldn't concentrate too much on the competitive aspect. Have some fun!

### 6. Profile & Statistics
Jass@EPFL keeps track of your matches history and keeps your statistics to better help you improve, show some important information about other players, school ranking and so on. All those information as well as your profile can be found under the Profile section.

### 7. Notifications
Notification is an important part of Jass@EPFL. Every time you invite a friend to a match or get information about a player joining or quitting your match, all of this happens through notifications. You are very encouraged to keep them on.

### 8. Scoreboard
When starting a match, you will automatically be redirected to the scoreboard. There you will be able to update your points, add an *Annonce*, view the score history of the match (or cancel something).
The scoreboard also has an offline mode, where your stats will not be saved and your ranking not updated, but enables more options. In offline mode, you can set a custom score goal and set a different goal for both teams.
