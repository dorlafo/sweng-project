## Jass Rules - Slalom

Slalom is a variant of Jass. The rules are similar to Oben Abe and Unden Ufe, so you should read these tutorials first.
It is actually a mix of those variants during each round. The first turn the highest card wins, the second turn the lowest wins, the third turn the highest wins, and so on. You must always follow the leading suit.
