## Jass Rules - Oben Abe

Oben Abe is a variant of Jass. The rules are a mix between Chibre War the card game for children. The best card always wins, but like in Chibre, you must follow the leading suit.
There is no *Atout* and to compensate that fact, the 8 are all worth 8 points, so there is still 157 points in total.
