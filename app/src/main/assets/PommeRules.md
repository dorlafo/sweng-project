## Jass Rules - Pomme

Pomme is a variant of Jass. The rules are similarto Chibre and Roi, so you should read those tutorials first.
This variant is meant to be played with only 2 players.
We played the same way we play Roi, only with two player and two piles are hidden, the one at the right of the dealer is the one you must turn on.
