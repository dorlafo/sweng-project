## Jass Rules - Pomme

Pomme is a variant of Jass. The rules are similar to Chibre and Roi, so you should read these tutorials first.
This variant is meant to be played with only 2 players.
We play the same way we play Roi, only with two player and two hidden piles, the one on the right of the dealer is the one you must turn on.
