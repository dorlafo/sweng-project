## Jass Rules - Pique Double

Pique Double is a very popular variant of Jass. The rules are almost the exact same as for Chibre, so you should read this tutorial.
For the changes, Pique Double is exactly what the name implies. When the selected *Atout* is Spade all points are doubled, even for the *Annonces* and the game goes to 1'500 points.
