## Jass Rules - Chibre
Chibre is the most commonly played variant of Jass and as such, the one every Jass player should learn first. The rules of Chibre will be the base for all variants which only modify some part of it. So you might consider this section as the most important if you are learning this beautiful game.

### 1. Basics
Jass is played with a deck of 36 cards (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 of each suit Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs and Spades). The strenght of the cards are in the order given, A is best, 6 worst.
Jass is essentially a game of points. The game is won by the team who first reaches a previously agreed target score, most often 1'000 for the Chibre variant (but can be 1'500 or 2'500). You can read more about points on the 'Score counting' section. Most Jass variants are played, like Chibre, in two teams of 2 players. Both party from a team seat across from each other, so that when playing the players playing right before and after you are your opponents. The game is played counter-clockwise. When playing, you must always play cards of the same suit as the first put on the table this turn, except in those two cases:
- You don't have it anymore, which allows you to play any other card, but beware that you cannot win the turn with a card of the wrong suit.
- You want to play an *Atout* (more on that in the next section) which is what we call *couper*. This allows you to win the turn if no stronger *Atout* was played.

The *Atout* is the cornerstone of Chibre. It is selected at the begining of every round. It must be one of the four suits and once selected it will be, for the remaining of this round, the strongest suit of all. You can play it whenever you want (always when it's your turn to play) and it will beat any other card of any other suit, however strong it is. There is two small modifications in the *Atout*, the strenght of the cards are in that order: J, 9, A, K, Q, 10, 8, 7, 6 and J is called *Buur* and 9 is called *Nell*.

### 3. Starting the game
All 36 cards are shuffled by the dealer (which can be anyone on the first round) and given 3 by 3 to each player until all are given. On the first round, the first player to speak is the one holding the starting card (most often the 7 of Diamonds or Hearts, depending on what you agreed before starting). On all futur rounds it will always be the first player on the right of the dealer. This player must select the *Atout* for this round. He can then start to play, then it is to the player at his right, and so on until the 4 players played their card. The strongest wins the turn and the player that played it can take the 4 cards (called *pli*), returns them so we dont see them anymore and keeps them until the end. Those card will give him points, so the purpose is to get as much as possible, but more on that later. The round then continues like that until all cards are played (9 rounds). At the end of the round, count the points for each team and write them in the app so it is saved until the end of the game.

### 4. Keep on playing
The player that selected the *Atout* becomes the dealer for next round and all is repeated with one big difference, the player whos turn it is to select the *Atout* can now *Chibrer* to his partner.
*Chibrer* means to let your partner select the *Atout* for you (if you can't decide with your cards), but you will still start the round. This is donne by saying *Chibre!* and it is now allowed for every reamaining round, in fact it is only forbiden during the first round.
The partner (of the player selecting the *Atout*) is, from now on, not allowed to watch his cards before the *Atout* was selected or *Chibre!* was said, to avoid any cheats. But the rest is the exact same, pretty easy isn't it?

### 5. Counting points
In Jass counting points is really easy and here are the points by cards:
- A = 11, K = 4, Q = 3, J = 2, 10 = 10 and 9, 8, 7, 6 = 0.

But as you got it by now, in *Atout* it is always different, and here's how:
- J = 20, 9 = 14, A = 11, K = 4, Q = 3, 10 = 10 and 8, 7, 6 = 0.

The total is always 157 points.

### 6. Add-ons
In Chibre you will fine as many add-ons to the rules as there is canton in Switzerland. But the most commun one is the *Annonces*.
The *Annonces* are worth points, but they require you to show parts of your cards. You must announce them when you play your first card of the round.
Here are the possible *Annonces*:
- 3 cards in a row (ex: 6, 7, 8 of clubs) = 20 points.
- 4 cards in a row (ex: 6, 7, 8, 9 of diamonds) = 50 points.
- 5 cards in a row (ex: 8, 9, 10, J, Q of hearts) = 100 points.
- 4 cards of the same kind (ex: all Queens) = 100 points.
- 4 nines  (all the *Nells*) = 150 points.
- 4 jacks (all the *Buurs*) = 200 points.

If you and your partner both made an *Annonce* or more (beware one card can only go in one *Annonce*), they all count together. If your opponent made one, only the highest one wins. The order of strength is the one listed above from weakest to strongest.
